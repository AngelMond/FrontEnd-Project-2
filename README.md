# FrontEnd with vanilla CSS 

# About this project 
* I loved building this website, it was a lot of hard work, but I learned a lot!
* For the construction of the web, I use vanilla CSS and different types of fonts were used, which you can see within the project.
* The web is responsive from smartphones to large monitors.
* Also, I used some animations for the web, so dont wait a lot to visit the deployed web! LINK BELOW!

# Why I used this technologies?
* Because I wanted to have more experience using vanilla CSS and I think it worked pretty well for me and now when using bootstrap I can feel a lot more comfortable.

# Challenges
* Well, I didn't use flexbox or grid for the responsive, so it was a very hard work, it took me like 4-5 days to write all the media queries, so the web could have a good view in all devices. 
* I have modularized the CSS styles and the responsive code in the CSS folder so you can take a look.
